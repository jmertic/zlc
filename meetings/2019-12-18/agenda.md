# ZLC Agenda 12-18-19

1. **Reminder no meeting the next two weeks - enjoy the holidays**  
2. **Status of 1.8 release**   	
	a.  Target is 1st week of January (slightly delayed from original target of 2019)   	
	b.  Component work in App Framework complete (I think)   	
	c.  Date move may mean the Active LTS is +/- Release 1.10 but content and date more important than actual release number   	
	d.  I've seen email asking for SSO complete for "LTS" .....it would be great to tout SSO at same time but from my view SMP/E and CUPIDS is MVP - we can discuss  
3.  **Rose will not be able to attend today - update from her regarding request to the On Boarding squad:**  
	a.  Working with Joe (W) on creating notices for  
		i.  The "Extenders" (to make them aware of the LTS release and that they'll need to start thinking about testing against the new conformance criteria  
		ii.  All of the squads to get their new conformance criteria posted.  
		iii.  We also have a proposal for "incoming" requests (will formalize this for your/ZLC review)  
4.  **Many thanks to Mark and Rose for thinking about schedule of LTS and Conformance program announcements/changes**  
	a.  Hopefully Mark will join the call and walk us through the schedule - net (I think) is we are running out of runway to get LTS policy announced, document required changes for consumers and update the conformance criteria.  
	b. [https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/nzyo4tq4xqvse4vahh3r60uhfdduog5j.xlsx](https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/nzyo4tq4xqvse4vahh3r60uhfdduog5j.xlsx)  
5.  **SHARE**  
	a.  I have been communicating with the speakers - roughed out an agenda (below) - need speakers to agree and I will advertise the topics  
	b.  Need help advertising session (Slack Dev channel, Linkedin)  
		i.  John - who to connect with at OMP?  
	c.  Enrollments still low (7 people according to SHARE) but they say that is typical for this time of year and should increase in Jan  
	d.  Speakers need to connect with Dan Jast if we want to use SHARE z box  
		i.  Maybe not time for full lab but maybe "guided tour" - Dan will have 1.7.1 installed  
		ii.  We can discuss with him about 1.8 once we have tested release - realize he has lab at Share on Wednesday as his top priority
